# System Organization & Navigation

For a user with the Administrator or Moderator type, the AP (***Figure 3***) appears after successful login.

The side menu, which is on the left side (***Figure 3***), and the top menu, which is underneath the banner at the top (***Figure 4***), list the tasks you can perform using the AP and the SSP of the IH Web application respectively. When you click a task (or a subtask under it) in the side or top menu, the task is displayed either in the work area, which is on the right side (AP) or the center (SSP), or in a new browser window (rarely).
