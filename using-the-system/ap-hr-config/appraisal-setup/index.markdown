## Self-Performance Assessment

Self-performance assessment (***Figure 30***) stores self-assessment questions including the question on the IH system. Each employee is given these questions to answer during their appraisal period.

The process of adding and editing self-assessment questions is like the bank setup. See [Bank Setup](/using-the-system/ap-hr-config/bank-setup/).

## Quantitative Assessment

Quantitative assessment (***Figure 31***) stores quantitative assessment questions including the question on the IH system. Quantitative assessment questions are stored for each job role on the IH system for supervisors to assess employees according to their different job roles in the company. Quantitative assessment questions comprise 20% of an employee’s appraisal result.

To add and edit quantitative assessment questions:  

**Action**: Click on ***Actions*** (see [Working with Tables](/getting-started/system-organization-navigation/working-with-tables/)) for the corresponding job role in the ***All Job Roles*** table to display the list of actions. Click on ***View Questions*** to open the ***Quantitative Assessment Questions*** task view (***Figure 32***).

The process of adding and editing quantitative assessment questions is like the bank setup. See [Bank Setup](/using-the-system/ap-hr-config/bank-setup/).  

**Note**: For initial setup, users must setup job roles before quantitative assessment questions. This is because quantitative assessment questions require their corresponding job role to exist on the IH system to be stored.

## Qualitative Assessment

Qualitative assessment (***Figure 33***) stores qualitative assessment questions including the question on the IH system. Supervisors assess employees with qualitative assessment questions which comprise 80% of an employee’s appraisal result.

##### Figure 33: IH AP Qualitative Assessment Questions
![qualitative assessment questions](qualitative-assessment-questions.PNG)

The process of adding and editing qualitative assessment questions is like the bank setup. See [Bank Setup](/using-the-system/ap-hr-config/bank-setup/).

## Supervisor Assessment

Supervisor assessment (***Figure 34***) stores supervisor assessment questions including the question on the IH system. Supervisors answer supervisor assessment questions to leave comments about their supervised employees.

The process of adding and editing supervisor assessment questions is like the bank setup. See [Bank Setup](/using-the-system/ap-hr-config/bank-setup/).
