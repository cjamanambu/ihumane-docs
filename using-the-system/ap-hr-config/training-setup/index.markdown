# Training Setup

Training setup (***Figure 38***) stores training information including the training name, training description, training materials (documents, images, audio or video files), and duration of the test to be taken after the training on the IH system. Trainings are assigned to employees who are required to take them and complete the corresponding test. The test questions can be added to the training once the training is created.
