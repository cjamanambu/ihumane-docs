# Grade Setup

Grade setup (***Figure 26***) stores grade information including the grade name on the IH system. Each employee is stored with their corresponding grade to collate the employee according to their grade level in the company.

The process of adding and editing grade information is like the bank setup. See [Bank Setup](/using-the-system/ap-hr-config/bank-setup/).
