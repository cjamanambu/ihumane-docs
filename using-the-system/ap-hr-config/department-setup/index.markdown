# Department Setup

Department setup (***Figure 25***) stores department information including the department name on the IH system. Each employee is stored with their corresponding department to collate the employee according to their department in the company.

The process of adding and editing department information is like the bank setup. See [Bank Setup](/using-the-system/ap-hr-config/bank-setup/).
