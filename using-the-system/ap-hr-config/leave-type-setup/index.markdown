# Leave Type Setup

Leave type setup (***Figure 37***) stores leave type information including the leave type name and the leave type allowed duration on the IH system. Each employee has a leave wallet containing all the leave types and their durations according to the companyâ€™s policy. This enables transparency when employees apply for their leave in the SSP.

The process of adding and editing leave type information is like the bank setup. See [Bank Setup](/using-the-system/ap-hr-config/bank-setup/).
