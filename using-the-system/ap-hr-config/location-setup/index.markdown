# Location Setup

Location setup (***Figure 28***) stores location/branch/SBU information including the location name on the IH system. Each employee is stored with their corresponding location to collate the employee according to their location/branch/SBU in the company.

The process of adding and editing location information is like the bank setup. See [Bank Setup](/using-the-system/ap-hr-config/bank-setup/).
