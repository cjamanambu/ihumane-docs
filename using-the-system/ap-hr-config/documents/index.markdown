# Documents

Documents setup (***Figure 46***) stores company related document information including the document name, document description and the document contents on the IH system. These documents could include documents such as the companyâ€™s policies etc. Employees access company related documents from the SSP.

The process of adding and editing document information is like the bank setup. See [Bank Setup](/using-the-system/ap-hr-config/bank-setup/).
