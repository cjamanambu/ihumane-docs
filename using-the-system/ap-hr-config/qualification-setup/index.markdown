# Qualification Setup

Qualification setup (***Figure 35***) stores qualification information including the qualification name on the IH system. Each employee is stored with their corresponding qualification to collate the employee according to their qualification.

The process of adding and editing qualification information is like the bank setup. See [Bank Setup](/using-the-system/ap-hr-config/bank-setup/).
