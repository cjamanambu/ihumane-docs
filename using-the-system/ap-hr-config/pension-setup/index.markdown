# Pension Setup

Pension setup (***Figure 23***) stores pension provider/administrator information including the pension provider name on the IH system. Each employee is stored with their corresponding pension provider to manage the employeeâ€™s pension payments.

The process of adding and editing pension provider information is like the bank setup. See [Bank Setup](/using-the-system/ap-hr-config/bank-setup/).
