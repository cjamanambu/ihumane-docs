# Job Roles Setup

Job roles setup (***Figure 27***) stores job role information including the job role name, the corresponding department, and a description of the job role in the IH system. Each employee is stored with their corresponding job role to collate the employee according to their job role in the company.

The process of adding and editing job role information is like the bank setup. See [Bank Setup](/using-the-system/ap-hr-config/bank-setup/).

**Note**: For initial setup, users must setup departments before job roles. This is because job role information requires its corresponding department to exist on the IH system to be stored.
