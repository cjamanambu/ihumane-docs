Figure 17: IH Tables . | . | Table Length In IH Web application, the table length option enables the user to determine the maximum number of rows of data to be displayed on each page of the table. By default, the minimum option is 10 but the table length options go up to a maximum of 100 rows of data. | Export Options Usually, tables in the IH Web application come with export options which enable the user to export the rows of data displaying on the current page of the table in different ways. The copy button copies the rows of data to the computer’s clipboard to be pasted elsewhere, the excel button exports the rows of data as a Microsoft Excel worksheet, the pdf button exports the rows of data as a PDF document, and the print button prints the rows of data. Note: The export options export only the rows of data that are displayed on the current page of the table, that is, after filtering, sorting or adjusting the table length. Further, exported data always excludes the Actions column. | Filter Input Field Users can filter the data in a table by typing key words into the input field to search the rows of data for matches with the key words. Clearing the input field resets the table to its default state. Filtering the table decreases the number of rows that are displayed and makes it easier for users to focus on specific data. | Sort Option Users can alter the ordering characteristics of the table based on a column in the table. By clicking the sort option in the column header, you can toggle between ascending and descending sorts for that column. When the sort option indicator points up, the column is sorted in ascending order. When the sort option indicator points down, the column is sorted in descending order. | Row Actions Clicking a row action will either display the view in an overlapping modal dialogue or as a new task or nested subtask view. Each row in the table represents a unique piece of data in the IH Web application for instance an employee, a salary structure or company department. Clicking on the row actions button lists the actions (Figure 18) that can be performed on each unique data for instance, users can view details or perform specific actions on the unique data. | Table Information The table information at the bottom of the table displays information about the table such as the number of records (rows of data) matching the filter criteria or the number of rows displayed on the current page, and the total number of rows in the whole table. | Paginator The paginator navigates between discrete pages in the table based on the maximum length of the page and the total number of rows in the table. For instance, if the maximum length of the page is the default 10 and there are more than 10 rows in the table, the user can click the next button or the specific page number in the paginator to move to the next or the specific page to display the remaining rows respectively. | .

The table below explains the different access rights and corresponding explanation for each user type. It is important to note that the user types are not necessarily identical to a person’s title. There are three user types with access to IH: . | User Types | Access Rights | . | Administrator | Although highly configurable, the Administrator typically has responsibility for all administrative aspects of the company’s IH instance. Administrators may have all the employee management, payroll management, biometrics, user management, app configuration, payroll configuration and hr configuration user permissions. Most important of these, however, is user management and app configuration, which enable the Administrators create other Administrators or change a user’s type from Employee to either Administrator or Moderator. Further, application settings for the company’s instance of IH are managed by the Administrator. Finally, Administrators only have access to the Admin Panel (AP) of IH. | . | Moderator | The Moderator differs from the Administrator mainly in two ways. First, the Moderator typically doesn’t have all the above permissions entirely, as Moderators only perform limited administrative tasks. For instance, the Accountant may only have the payroll management and payroll configuration user permissions to manage the Payroll Process and not app configuration to modify the application’s settings. Further, the Moderator can switch between the AP and the Self-Service Portal (SSP) of IH as they also perform Employee functions within the company. The Moderator may also modify a user’s type if assigned the permission to do so. | . | Employee | The Employee doesn’t have access to the AP and as such doesn’t have user permissions. The Employee access is limited to the SSP and the range of functions it offers. A user of Employee type can be modified to the Moderator or Administrator types with configurable permissions by the Administrator or a Moderator with the user permission to do so. | . ",
