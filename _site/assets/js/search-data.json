The table below explains the different access rights and corresponding explanation for each user type. It is important to note that the user types are not necessarily identical to a person’s title. There are three user types with access to IH: . | User Types | Access Rights | . | Administrator | Although highly configurable, the Administrator typically has responsibility for all administrative aspects of the company’s IH instance. Administrators may have all the employee management, payroll management, biometrics, user management, app configuration, payroll configuration and hr configuration user permissions. Most important of these, however, is user management and app configuration, which enable the Administrators create other Administrators or change a user’s type from Employee to either Administrator or Moderator. Further, application settings for the company’s instance of IH are managed by the Administrator. Finally, Administrators only have access to the Admin Panel (AP) of IH. | . | Moderator | The Moderator differs from the Administrator mainly in two ways. First, the Moderator typically doesn’t have all the above permissions entirely, as Moderators only perform limited administrative tasks. For instance, the Accountant may only have the payroll management and payroll configuration user permissions to manage the Payroll Process and not app configuration to modify the application’s settings. Further, the Moderator can switch between the AP and the Self-Service Portal (SSP) of IH as they also perform Employee functions within the company. The Moderator may also modify a user’s type if assigned the permission to do so. | . | Employee | The Employee doesn’t have access to the AP and as such doesn’t have user permissions. The Employee access is limited to the SSP and the range of functions it offers. A user of Employee type can be modified to the Moderator or Administrator types with configurable permissions by the Administrator or a Moderator with the user permission to do so. | . ",
